<img src="yankee_stadium.jpg" style="float:right; margin-right: 30px">
<p style="padding-right:500px; padding-top:125px">The Original name of this New York team was the New York Highlanders, and they began playing in the early 1900s. Before they were based in New York, they went by the Name the Baltimore Orioles *and they have no relation to the current Maryland team. They began to get referred to as the yankees simply because they were an American Name, but the same stuck.
